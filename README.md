CycloneDX Core (Java)
=========

The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the BOM along with utilities to assist in creating, 
validating, and parsing BOMs. CycloneDX is a lightweight BoM specification that is easily created, human readable, 
and simple to parse. The resulting bom.xml can be used with tools such as [OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) 
for the continuous analysis of components.
